# import-organiser

This is a simple tool that organises imports in Python.
Imports are alphabetically ordered.
The 'import' comes before 'from ... import ...' 

Usage:
In terminal> python import_organiser.py --file=FILE_NAME.py
This will create another py file that has 'organised_' as a prefix + FILE_NAME.py
Alternatively, you can change that behaviour in the code.
